# 💭 A Note from the Dev
This app was made in a soft moment and a little chaos.
Use it when:

you’re feeling too much (or nothing at all)

you need a song to scream into your pillow

you want to find beauty in the breakdown

💌 Feel free to fork, remix, and add your own moods. Just don’t forget to cry a little. Or dance. Or both. (´｡• ᵕ •｡`) ♡
